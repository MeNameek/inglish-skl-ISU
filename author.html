  <h2>Lawrence Hill</h2>
  <p>
    Lawrence Hill is a Canadian novelist and essayist known for exploring issues of race,
    identity, history, and social justice. His writing often focuses on people whose stories
    are ignored or erased by mainstream society.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hill gained international recognition for his novel The Book of Negroes, which examines
    the history of slavery and displacement. Much of his work is shaped by extensive research
    and a strong commitment to historical and social accuracy.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a writer, Hill believes literature can be used to challenge readers and encourage empathy.
    Rather than offering simple answers, his novels force readers to confront complex moral issues.
  </p>
  </p>
  Did you know? Lawrence Hill was actually born in Newmarket!

  <h2>Purpose Behind The Illegal</h2>
  <p>
    Lawrence Hill wrote The Illegal after researching refugee crises and immigration policies around the world. He was particularly interested in how wealthy nations often rely on immigrant labor while simultaneously criminalizing undocumented refugees.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hill has said that many discussions about immigration are abstract and fail to show the human cost. The Illegal was written to place readers inside the experience of a refugee, allowing them to understand the fear, uncertainty, and struggle for survival that people face. By telling Keita Ali’s story, Hill encourages readers to think critically about justice, privilege, and the moral responsibilities of society toward those forced to flee their homes.

  <h2>Writing Style and Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Lawrence Hill’s writing style is realistic and emotionally grounded. He avoids exaggeration and lets events and characters speak for themselves, which makes the novel more powerful, believable, and relatable.
  </p>
  <p>
    By combining fiction with real world issues such as immigration, inequality, and oppression, Hill creates a story that is both engaging and socially meaningful. Readers are drawn into Keita Ali’s struggles while being encouraged to reflect on broader questions of justice, morality, and human dignity.
