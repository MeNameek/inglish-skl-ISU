  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The Illegal tells the story of Keita Ali, a young and talented long distance runner from the
    fictional island nation of Zantoroland. In his country, poverty is widespread and political
    corruption controls nearly every aspect of life. Running is one of the few ways a person can
    gain respect, opportunity, and a possible escape from suffering.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keita trains relentlessly under harsh conditions, hoping his talent will one day allow him
    to support his family. His father believes strongly in justice and openly criticizes the
    government, which places the family in danger. When his father is murdered for speaking out,
    Keita realizes that staying in Zantoroland will likely lead to his own death.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keita flees the country with the help of a corrupt sports agent who promises him a future
    as a professional runner. Instead, Keita is manipulated and exploited, treated as a product
    rather than a person. Eventually, he escapes and reaches Freedom State, a wealthy nation
    that publicly claims to support human rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Freedom State, Keita discovers that refugees without legal status are hunted, detained,
    and deported. He is forced to live underground in a hidden refugee community where fear is
    constant. Keita survives by secretly running in road races for cash, knowing that being
    caught could mean imprisonment or death.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the government tightens immigration laws and public hostility increases, Keita is pushed
    to his physical and emotional limits. The novel follows his struggle to stay alive while
    questioning whether a society can call itself just while treating survival as a crime.

  <h2>Setting and Context</h2>

  <img src="images/hero-background.png" alt="Warm desert like landscape representing the novels setting" class="page-img wide">
  
  <p>
    The novel takes place primarily in two fictional countries. Zantoroland represents nations
    affected by extreme poverty, political instability, and violence. Citizens have little
    protection from those in power, and speaking out can result in severe punishment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Freedom State represents wealthy Western nations that benefit from global inequality while
    enforcing strict immigration laws. Although the country presents itself as fair and lawful,
    its treatment of refugees reveals deep hypocrisy.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using fictional settings, Lawrence Hill avoids targeting a specific country and instead
    exposes global patterns of injustice found throughout the world.

  <h2>Central Message</h2>
  <p>
    The central message of The Illegal is that no human being should be considered illegal.
    The novel challenges readers to examine how laws and borders are used to exclude and punish
    vulnerable people rather than protect them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hill forces readers to confront uncomfortable questions about privilege, responsibility,
    and compassion in a world shaped by inequality.
