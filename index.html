  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The Illegal tells the story of Keita Ali, a young and talented long distance runner from the island nation of Zantoroland. In his country, widespread poverty and political corruption control nearly every aspect of life. Running is one of the few ways a person can gain respect, opportunity, and a possible escape from suffering.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keita trains relentlessly under harsh conditions, hoping his talent will one day allow him to support his family. His father openly criticizes the government and is murdered for speaking out, forcing Keita to flee Zantoroland. With the help of a corrupt sports agent, Keita escapes the country but is quickly exploited and treated as a commodity rather than a human being.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keita eventually reaches Freedom State, a wealthy nation that claims to value human rights but aggressively targets undocumented migrants. Living illegally, Keita is forced into hiding within a refugee community while secretly running in road races to survive and raise money to rescue his kidnapped sister, Charity. Throughout this time, he receives help from journalist Viola Hill, whose investigation exposes corruption within the government.
  </p>
  <p>
    As immigration laws tighten and public hostility increases, Keita struggle becomes more dangerous. The novel follows his fight for survival, justice, and legal recognition, challenging the idea of whether a society can be considered just when simply existing is treated as a crime.

  <h2>Setting and Context</h2>

  <img src="images/hero-background.png" alt="Warm desert like landscape representing the novels setting" class="page-img wide">

  <p>
    The novel takes place primarily in two fictional countries with contrasting environments. Zantoroland is depicted as a harsh and unstable nation affected by extreme poverty, political corruption, and violence. Citizens have little protection from those in power, and speaking out against the government can result in imprisonment or death.
  </p>
  <p>
    Freedom State represents wealthy Western nations that benefit from global inequality while enforcing strict immigration laws. Although it presents itself as fair and democratic, its treatment of refugees reveals deep hypocrisy and systemic racism. Undocumented migrants are criminalized and forced to live in hiding.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using fictional countries rather than real ones, Lawrence Hill avoids targeting a single nation and instead exposes global patterns of injustice. This approach allows the novel to reflect real world issues surrounding immigration, power, and inequality on a broader scale.

  <h2>Central Message</h2>
  <p>
    The central message of The Illegal is that no human being should be considered illegal. Through Keita experiences as a refugee, the novel challenges readers to examine how laws and borders are often used to exclude and punish vulnerable people rather than protect them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lawrence Hill forces readers to confront uncomfortable questions about privilege, responsibility, and compassion in a world shaped by inequality. By portraying a society that criminalizes survival, the novel argues that justice should be based on humanity rather than legal status.
