  <h2>Theme: Illegality and Dehumanization</h2>

  <img src="images/refugee-community.png" alt="Refugee community representing displacement and survival" class="page-img wide">

  <p>
    One of the most important themes in The Illegal is the idea of illegality.
    The novel shows how refugees are not only denied legal status, but also denied
    their humanity. Once a person is labeled illegal, they are treated as a problem
    rather than as a human being.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hill demonstrates that laws can be used as tools of exclusion.
    Keita does not become less human because he crosses a border,
    yet the government of Freedom State treats him as disposable.
    This theme forces readers to question whether legality should determine a persons value.
  </p>

  <h2>Theme: Running as Survival</h2>
  <p>
    Running is more than a sport in this novel. For Keita, running is survival.
    In Zantoroland, running offers a chance to escape poverty.
    In Freedom State, running becomes a way to stay alive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hill uses running as a symbol of constant motion.
    Keita cannot stop moving without risking capture or death.
    This reflects the reality of refugees who are never truly safe,
    even after reaching a new country.

  <h2>Theme: Identity and Worth</h2>
  <p>
    A major theme in The Illegal is the idea of identity being defined by legal status.
    Once Keita is labeled illegal, his achievements, character, and humanity are ignored.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hill shows how labels can strip people of dignity and reduce them to problems rather than
    individuals. The novel argues that worth should not be determined by paperwork.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card slide-up">
  <h2>Theme: Fear and Control</h2>
  <p>
    Fear is used as a tool of control throughout the novel. Refugees are kept in a constant state
    of anxiety through raids, detention, and public hostility.
  </p>
  <p>
    This fear prevents unity and resistance, allowing governments to maintain power without
    addressing injustice.
  </p>

<section class="card slide-up">
  <h2>Overall Significance</h2>
  <p>
    The Illegal is significant because it humanizes global refugee issues.
    Rather than focusing on statistics or policy debates, the novel tells a personal story
    that encourages empathy and understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hill reminds readers that behind every border and law is a human life struggling to survive.
