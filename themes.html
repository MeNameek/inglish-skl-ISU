  <h2>Theme: Illegality and Dehumanization</h2>

  <p>
    One of the most important themes in The Illegal is the concept of illegality and its effect on human dignity. The novel shows that refugees are not only denied legal status but are often treated as less than human. Once someone is labeled illegal, they are seen as a problem rather than as a person with rights and feelings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lawrence Hill demonstrates how laws can be used as tools of exclusion. Keita does not lose his humanity by crossing a border, yet the government of Freedom State treats him as disposable. This theme forces readers to question whether a person’s legal status should determine their value and challenges society to reconsider the fairness of such systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Theme: Running as Survival</h2>
  <p>
    In The Illegal, running is more than a sport; for Keita, it is a matter of survival. In Zantoroland, running offers a way to gain respect, opportunity, and a possible escape from poverty. In Freedom State, it becomes a way to stay alive while hiding from authorities and raising money to protect his sister.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lawrence Hill uses running as a symbol of constant motion and resilience. Keita cannot stop moving without risking capture or death, reflecting the reality of refugees who are never completely safe, even after fleeing their home countries. Running represents both physical survival and the perseverance of the human spirit.

  <h2>Theme: Identity and Worth</h2>
  <p>
    A major theme in The Illegal is how identity and worth are shaped—or diminished—by legal status. Once Keita is labeled illegal, his achievements, character, and humanity are ignored, and he is treated as a problem rather than a person.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lawrence Hill shows how labels and bureaucracy can strip people of dignity, reducing them to statistics or obstacles instead of recognizing their full humanity. The novel argues that a person’s value should not be determined by paperwork or citizenship, but by their actions, character, and inherent human worth.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card slide-up">
  <h2>Theme: Fear and Control</h2>
  <p>
    Fear is used as a tool of control throughout The Illegal. Refugees are kept in a constant state of anxiety through raids, detention, and public hostility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lawrence Hill shows that this fear prevents refugees from organizing or resisting, allowing governments and those in power to maintain control without addressing injustice. The novel highlights how fear can be weaponized to oppress vulnerable populations and maintain systemic inequality.
  </p>

  <h2>Overall Significance</h2>
  <p>
    The Illegal is significant because it humanizes global refugee issues. Instead of focusing on statistics or abstract policy debates, the novel tells a personal story that encourages empathy and understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lawrence Hill reminds readers that behind every border, law, and political decision is a human life struggling to survive. By centering Keita Ali’s experiences, the novel emphasizes the human cost of systemic injustice and challenges readers to consider their own responsibility toward vulnerable populations.
